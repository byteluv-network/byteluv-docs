# ByteLuv Wiki

Welcome to the ByteLuv Wiki! This is the place where you can find all the information you need to get started with ByteLuv.

## Let's understand ByteLuv

ByteLuv is a decentralized dating platform, meaning that it is a dating platform that is not controlled by a single entity. It is built on the blockchain, which is a decentralized network of computers that work together to manage and record transactions. This means that ByteLuv is secure, transparent, and resistant to censorship.

## Why ByteLuv?

We built a totally different approach to dating, allowing users to interact with each other in a fair, secure, and transparent way. There is no algorithms rather only users with common interests can interact with each other. No matter the resources, users will only be able to use the same features and have a limited number of interactions per day.

## How does ByteLuv work?

Let's say you are looking for a date. Just like real life, you will go to a place to meet people. In ByteLuv, you will be able to choose places to meet people, such as a park, a restaurant, or a bar. Based on the locations you pick, you will be able to see other users who are also looking for a date in the same place. You can then think of \$BLUV tokens as the time you have to spend in order to interact with other users. You can spend \$BLUV tokens to interact with other users, such as staking on them. If the other user is also interested in you, they can stake on you as well. If both users stake on each other, they can start chatting and get to know each other better.
