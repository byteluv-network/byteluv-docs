# ByteLuv Wiki

Welcome to the ByteLuv Wiki! This is the place where you can find all the information you need to get started with ByteLuv.

## Let's understand ByteLuv

ByteLuv is a decentralized dating platform, meaning that it is a dating platform that is not controlled by a single entity. It is built on the blockchain, which is a decentralized network of computers that work together to manage the platform. Making dating decentralized means that users have more control over their data and interactions, and that the platform is more secure and transparent.

## Why ByteLuv?

We built a totally different approach to dating, allowing users to interact with each other in a fair, secure, and transparent way. There is no algorithms rather only users with common interests can interact with each other. No matter the resources, users will only be able to use the same features and have a limited number of interactions per day.

## How does ByteLuv work?

Let's say you are looking for a date. Just like real life, you will go to a place to meet people. In ByteLuv, you will be able to choose places to meet people, such as a park, a restaurant, or a bar. Based on the locations you pick, you will be able to see other users who are also looking for a date in the same place. Then you can utilize BLUV to interact with other users. 

## What is BLUV

You can then think of BLUV as time, you spend time liking someone, going to places and loving other people right? You can spend BLUV to interact with other users, such as liking and matching them. If the other half is also interested in you too, they can also spend BLUV liking you. If both users spend the same amount of BLUV on each other, they will match and start chatting and get to know each other better. 

## How to get started?

1. Create an account on ByteLuv. (You will need a wallet to create an account)
2. Set up your profile. (Your profile will then be verified as an actual human)
3. Enter the game and start! (Choose a place to meet people and start interacting with them)
