# ByteLuv Game Actions

These are the only actions you can perform in the ByteLuv game. Each action will affect your balance, useable balance and BLUV held.

## Exploring People
import byteluvExplore from './images/ByteLuv-App-Explore.png'

When you enter the game, you will be able to see all the users that have chosen the same location as you. You can explore their profiles and decide if you want to interact with them or not.

**View More Pictures**: Just like Instagram, you can tap on the `left` or `right` side of the profile picture to view more pictures.

**View Profile**: Click on any area below the `profile name` to view the whole user profile.

Here's how the explore page looks like:

## Filtering
import byteluvFilter1 from './images/ByteLuv-App-Filter-Demo-1.png'

In ByteLuv, you can filter users based on their location, age, gender and dating preferences. You can also choose between a swiping or scrolling view to explore users.

**To filter users:** Click on the `Filter` icon on the top right corner of the explore page.

**To change the view:** Click on the `List` icon or `Shuffle` icon on the top right corner of the explore page.

Here's how the filter page looks like:

## Like
import byteluvLike from './images/ByteLuv-App-Like.png'

Liking is completely different from other dating apps. In ByteLuv, you like a user with BLUV. This action will allow you to show interest in another user, and if the other user is also interested in you, they can like you back. If both users like each other, you [match](#match) and can start chatting and get to know each other better. 

You can see who liked you and how much they liked you

**Fun Fact**: You can like 100 users or 1 user per round, it's up to you to decide how much BLUV to spend on each user.

**To like a user:** Click on the `Heart` icon on the user's profile. When the like modal pops up, `Enter` the amount of BLUV you want to like the user with. Then click on the `Like` button.

Here's how the like page looks like:

## Match
import byteluvMatch from './images/ByteLuv-App-Match.png'

Matching is when 2 users spend the same amount of BLUV tokens to [like](#like) each other. This action will allow you to start chatting and get to know each other better.

**Matching with a user**: Just like [liking](#like), you will also need to `Enter` the amount of BLUV you want to like the user with. Then click on the `Match` button.

**Fun Fact**: `Entering` a different amount of BLUV than the user who liked you will open the [like back](#like-back) page, allowing you to like back with a different amount of BLUV.

Here's how the match page looks like:

<img src={byteluvMatch} style={{ width: "200px", height: "auto" }} alt="ByteLuv App Match" />


## Like Back
import byteluvLikeBack from './images/ByteLuv-App-Like-Back.png'

Liking Back is when a user likes you and you like them back. This action will allow you to [match](#match) with the user and start chatting and get to know each other better. 

**Fun Fact**: You can like back more/less than the user who liked you, forcing them to spend more/less BLUV to match with you. More for more commitment, less for less commitment.

**Notice**: You will find that when you are liking back, you will be `Informed` of the amount the user liked you with, and you can choose to like back with the same amount or a different amount.

Here's how the like back page looks like:

<img src={byteluvLikeBack} style={{ width: "200px", height: "auto" }} alt="ByteLuv App Like Back" />

## Nice Job!

You have now learned all the actions you can perform in the ByteLuv game, let's learn more about the matching mechanisms!

<!-- ## Stake

`Staking` is the process of committing a certain amount of \$BLUV tokens to another user, from your **[stash](./terminologies-of-byteluv#stash)**. This action will allow you to show interest in another user, and if the other user is also interested in you, they can stake on you as well. If both users stake on each other, they can start chatting and get to know each other better.
    - Users need to set a minimum amount of \$BLUV tokens for other users to stake on them.
    - Users can see who staked on them and how much they staked.

:::danger
There is a 5% chance the tokens you spend staking will be lost, think carefully, is he/she the one? Is it worth the risk?

## Soft Eliminate

`Soft Eliminating` is the process of committing a certain amount of \$BLUV tokens to another user, from your **[stash](./terminologies-of-byteluv#stash)**. This action will allow you to keep the user's profile brought forward to the next round of the game, but you will not be able to interact with them this round.
    - Users need to **[freeze](./terminologies-of-byteluv#freeze)** 1 \$BLUV token to soft eliminate another user.

## Eliminate

Just ignore the user, like they never existed. This action will remove the user's profile from your list of users to interact with in the current round of the game.
    - Users can eliminate a user without freezing any \$BLUV tokens. -->
