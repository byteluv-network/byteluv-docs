# ByteLuv Game Actions

These are the only actions you can perform in the ByteLuv game. Each action will affect your balance, useable balance and BLUV held.

## Like

`Liking` is completely different from other dating apps. In ByteLuv, you `like` a user with BLUV. This action will allow you to show interest in another user, and if the other user is also interested in you, they can `like` you back. If both users `like` each other, you `match` and can start chatting and get to know each other better. 

You can see who liked you and how much they liked you

**Fun Fact**: You can like 100 users or 1 user per round, it's up to you to decide how much BLUV to spend on each user.

## Like Back

`Liking Back` is when a user `likes` you and you `like` them back. This action will allow you to `match` with the user and start chatting and get to know each other better. 

**Fun Fact**: You can like back more/less than the user who liked you, forcing them to spend more/less BLUV to match with you. More for more commitment, less for less commitment.

## Match

`Matching` is when 2 users spend the same amount of BLUV tokens to `like` each other. This action will allow you to start chatting and get to know each other better.

<!-- ## Stake

`Staking` is the process of committing a certain amount of \$BLUV tokens to another user, from your **[stash](./terminologies-of-byteluv#stash)**. This action will allow you to show interest in another user, and if the other user is also interested in you, they can stake on you as well. If both users stake on each other, they can start chatting and get to know each other better.
    - Users need to set a minimum amount of \$BLUV tokens for other users to stake on them.
    - Users can see who staked on them and how much they staked.

:::danger
There is a 5% chance the tokens you spend staking will be lost, think carefully, is he/she the one? Is it worth the risk?

## Soft Eliminate

`Soft Eliminating` is the process of committing a certain amount of \$BLUV tokens to another user, from your **[stash](./terminologies-of-byteluv#stash)**. This action will allow you to keep the user's profile brought forward to the next round of the game, but you will not be able to interact with them this round.
    - Users need to **[freeze](./terminologies-of-byteluv#freeze)** 1 \$BLUV token to soft eliminate another user.

## Eliminate

Just ignore the user, like they never existed. This action will remove the user's profile from your list of users to interact with in the current round of the game.
    - Users can eliminate a user without freezing any \$BLUV tokens. -->
