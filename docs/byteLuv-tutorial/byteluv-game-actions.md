# ByteLuv Game Actions

These are the only actions you can perform in the ByteLuv game. Each action will require you to **[freeze](./terminologies-of-byteluv#freeze)** a certain amount of $BLUV tokens in your **[stash](./terminologies-of-byteluv#stash)**.

## Stake

`Staking` is the process of committing a certain amount of $BLUV tokens to another user, from your **[stash](./terminologies-of-byteluv#stash)**. This action will allow you to show interest in another user, and if the other user is also interested in you, they can stake on you as well. If both users stake on each other, they can start chatting and get to know each other better.
    - Users need to set a minimum amount of $BLUV tokens for other users to stake on them.
    - Users can see who staked on them and how much they staked.

## Soft Eliminate

`Soft Eliminating` is the process of committing a certain amount of $BLUV tokens to another user, from your **[stash](./terminologies-of-byteluv#stash)**. This action will allow you to keep the user's profile brought forward to the next round of the game, but you will not be able to interact with them this round.
    - Users need to **[freeze](./terminologies-of-byteluv#freeze)** 1 $BLUV token to soft eliminate another user.

## Eliminate

Just ignore the user, like they never existed. This action will remove the user's profile from your list of users to interact with in the current round of the game.
    - Users can eliminate a user without freezing any $BLUV tokens.
