# ByteLuv Match

Matching is why all of you are here. To find your love. Here's how you can match with someone on ByteLuv.

## Liking 
import preMatch from './images/ByteLuv-Pre-Match.png'

Just like mentioned in the **[ByteLuv Game Actions](./byteluv-game-actions.md#like)**, you can like a user with BLUV, and they need to like you back with the same amount for you to match with them. 

<img src={preMatch} style={{ width: "200px", height: "auto" }} alt="ByteLuv Wallet Website" />

This action will transfer BLUV from your useable balance to your BLUV held balance, your wallet balance will not be affected.

So, what's next?

## Matched
import postMatch from './images/ByteLuv-Post-Match.png'

After you matched with someone, you will be able to get the other party's contact information. You can then proceed to contact them and arrange for a date.

<img src={postMatch} style={{ width: "200px", height: "auto" }} alt="ByteLuv Wallet Website" />

Then, BLUV from your wallet balance will be held by the system until both parties decide to `unmatch`, the held BLUV will remain the same, which will reset when you `unmatch`.

And yes, this will affect your BLUV held the next round of the game.

## Unmatching

If you decide to unmatch with the other party, the BLUV held by the system will be released back to your wallet balance, but depending on the outcome of the match.

**How does the outcome of the match affect the BLUV held?**
- You will need to choose 2 options about the other party:
  - Satisfied 
  - Not Satisfied
- The other party will also need to choose the same option as you to free the BLUV held by the system back to your wallet balance as well as the other party's wallet balance.
- The outcome of this is as below:
  - Where 100% is the total amount of matched-frozen tokens of both parties. 

    |                                     | User B: Satisfied     | User B: Not Satisfied     |
    |-------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
    | Player A: Satisfied                 | A: 50%, B: 50%        | A: 0%, B: 100%            |
    | Player A: Not Satisfied             | A: 100%, B: 0%        | A: 0%, B: 0%              |
