# ByteLuv Match

Matching is why all of you are here. Get ready to be mind-blown by the power of ByteLuv's matching mechanism.

## Liking with \$BLUV - Staking

Instead of liking, you will need to show how much you like them by staking \$BLUV from your **[stash](terminologies-of-byteluv.md#stash)**. Here are a list of what you can do with the staking feature:
1. Once staked one someone, he/she will be able to see that you have staked on them.
2. To match, the other party will need to stake back on you. **( THE SAME AMOUNT )**
3. If the other party does not stake back, you will get your \$BLUV back after today's game ends.
4. If the other party staked back, you will be matched and the staked amount will be **[matched-frozen](terminologies-of-byteluv.md#matched-frozen)**.

## Matched

After you matched with someone, you will be able to get the other party's contact information. You can then proceed to contact them and arrange for a date.

*Note about your tokens being matched-frozen: This will affect the number of tokens in your stash the next round*

## Unmatching

Breaking a match is the process of unmatching with another `user`. This will allow you to unlock the **[Matched-Frozen](terminologies-of-byteluv.md#matched-frozen)** \$BLUV tokens and return them to your **[stash](./terminologies-of-byteluv.md#stash)**.

**But here's the catch:**
- You will need to choose 2 options about the other party:
  - Enjoyed Match
  - Not Enjoyed Match
- The other party will also need to choose the same option as you to unlock the matched-frozen tokens.
- The outcome of this is as below:
  - Where 100% is the total amount of matched-frozen tokens of both parties. 

    |                                     | User B: Enjoyed Match | User B: Not Enjoyed Match |
    |-------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
    | Player A: Enjoyed Match             | A: 50%, B: 50%        | A: 20%, B: 80%            |
    | Player A: Not Enjoyed Match         | A: 80%, B: 20%        | A: 20%, B: 20%            |

:::tip Always Enjoy the Match
For both parties to get the most out of the match, it is recommended to always choose the `Enjoyed Match` option.

:::danger Not Enjoyed Match
If both parties choose the `Not Enjoyed Match` option, both parties will lose 80% of the matched-frozen tokens and the tokens goes to the platform.
