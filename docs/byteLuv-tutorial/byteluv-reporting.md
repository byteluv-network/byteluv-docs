# ByteLuv Reporting

Reporting is an essential feature of the ByteLuv platform. It allows users to report any inappropriate behavior or content they encounter while using the platform. This helps maintain a safe and secure environment for all users.

## How does reporting work?

Reporting on ByteLuv is a straightforward process. If you come across any content or behavior that you find inappropriate, you can report it by following these steps:

1. **Click on the Report Button**: When you encounter inappropriate content or behavior, look for the report button on the platform.
2. **Wait for 9 other users to report**: Once you report the content, the platform will wait for 9 other users to report the same content before taking any action.
3. **Content Review**: Once the content has been reported by 10 users, it will be reviewed by the platform's verifiers.
4. **Action Taken**: Based on the verifiers' review, appropriate action will be taken, such as removing the content or banning the user responsible for the inappropriate behavior.
