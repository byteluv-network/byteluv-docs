# ByteLuv Reporting

Reporting is an essential feature of the ByteLuv platform. It allows users to report any inappropriate behavior or content they encounter while using the platform. This helps maintain a safe and secure environment for all users.

## How does reporting work?

We will have a dedicated team of moderators who will review all reports submitted by users. If a report is found to be valid, appropriate action will be taken against the reported user.

## What can be reported?

You can report any of the following:
1. Inappropriate behavior
2. Offensive content
3. Scams or fraudulent activities
4. Violation of platform rules

## How to report?

You can just text any of the admins on our [Telegram](https://t.me/ByteLuv)
