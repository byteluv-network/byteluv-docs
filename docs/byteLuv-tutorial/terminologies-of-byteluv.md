Let's get familiar with the terminologies used while finding your love.

## Wallet
import byteluv from './images/ByteLuv-Wallet-UI.png'

<img src={byteluv} style={{ width: "200px", height: "auto" }} alt="ByteLuv Wallet Website" />
In the above, you can see your:
- Wallet balance (10,000 BLUV)
- Useable balance (55 BLUV)
- BLUV held by choosing locations, liking and matching. (45 BLUV)
- Wallet Address (BjfM4wL3UU9G52A6uyBbMkfKr3XByxxGvAe7Vtto2Pxq) - This is your unique address 

:::tip
Realise that although you have 10,000 BLUV in your wallet, you can only utilize 100 BLUV to play the game. Making the game fair for everyone.
:::

## Balance

The amount of BLUV in your wallet.

## Useable Balance

The amount of BLUV in your wallet that you can utilize to play the game. This is the number that you will need to look at to make decisions on who you shoud like or match with.

## BLUV Held

The amount of BLUV in your wallet that is held by choosing locations, liking and matching.

:::note
This is the amount of BLUV that you have committed to choosing different locations, liking and matching with other users.
:::

## Wallet Address

The unique address that is associated with your wallet. This is the address that you will need to share with other users to match with them.



<!-- ## Lock

`Locking` is the process of commiting a certain amount of $BLUV tokens to a specific action, from your wallet into the **[stash](#stash)**.
1. `locking` does not mean you are losing the tokens, it just means you are committing them to a specific action. (e.g. Playing a game, interacting with other users)
2. `Locking` in ByteLuv is the only way you can play the game and interact with other users.
3. There will always be a duration set for the lock, after which you can **[unlock](#unlock)** the tokens back into your wallet.

## Unlock

`Unlocking` is the process of releasing the tokens that you have **[locked](#lock)** in your **[stash](#stash)** back into your wallet.
- Typically, you will unlock your tokens after the round of game has ended or after you have finished interacting with other users.

## Stash

`Stash` is the tokens that you have locked in your wallet.
1. `Stash` is the amount of tokens that you have locked in your wallet.
2. Actions that you take in the game will affect the amount of tokens in your `stash` through **[freezing](#freeze)**  (e.g. staking on other users, playing games)
3. `Stash` will be reset at the beginning each \$BLUV cycle, unless you **[match](byteluv-match)** with another user.

## Freeze

`Freezing` is the process of locking a certain amount of \$BLUV tokens in your **[stash](#stash)** until the end of the \$BLUV cycle.
- Typically, you will freeze your tokens after using balance in you **[stash](#stash)** to stake on other users or playing games.

## Matched-Frozen

`Matched-Frozen` is the process of locking a certain amount of $BLUV tokens in your **[stash](#stash)** after you have **[match](byteluv-match)** with another user. This amount of tokens will be brought forward from game to game until you decide to **[match](./byteluv-match)** with the user or you have matched successfully.
- *Think of it as a commitment to the other user that you are interested in them.* -->
