# Terminologies of ByteLuv

Here are the terms used in ByteLuv to manage your $BLUV tokens while using the platform:

## Lock

`Locking` is the process of commiting a certain amount of $BLUV tokens to a specific action, from your wallet into the **[stash](#stash)**.
1. `locking` does not mean you are losing the tokens, it just means you are committing them to a specific action. (e.g. Playing a game, interacting with other users)
2. `Locking` in ByteLuv is the only way you can play the game and interact with other users.
3. There will always be a duration set for the lock, after which you can **[unlock](#unlock)** the tokens back into your wallet.

## Unlock

`Unlocking` is the process of releasing the tokens that you have **[locked](#lock)** in your **[stash](#stash)** back into your wallet.
- Typically, you will unlock your tokens after the round of game has ended or after you have finished interacting with other users.

## Stash

`Stash` is the tokens that you have locked in your wallet.
1. `Stash` is the amount of tokens that you have locked in your wallet.
2. Actions that you take in the game will affect the amount of tokens in your `stash` through **[freezing](#freeze)**  (e.g. staking on other users, playing games)
3. `Stash` will be reset at the beginning each \$BLUV cycle, unless you **[match](byteluv-match)** with another user.

## Freeze

`Freezing` is the process of locking a certain amount of $BLUV tokens in your **[stash](#stash)** until the end of the \$BLUV cycle.
- Typically, you will freeze your tokens after using balance in you **[stash](#stash)** to stake on other users or playing games.

## Matched-Frozen

`Matched-Frozen` is the process of locking a certain amount of $BLUV tokens in your **[stash](#stash)** after you have **[match](byteluv-match)** with another user. This amount of tokens will be brought forward from game to game until you decide to **[match](./byteluv-match)** with the user or you have matched successfully.
- *Think of it as a commitment to the other user that you are interested in them.*
