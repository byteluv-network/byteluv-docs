# Overview

At ByteLuv, we aim to be the most realistic and transparent dating platform in the world. We believe that the current dating platforms are not transparent enough and are not realistic. For example, someone that came from another country will get pushed up in a different country, which is not very realistic considering the fact that they do not know anything about this country. Algorithms have caused this social world to lose so much of its authenticity. We are here to change that. 

With the Pink Paper, we will show you every single detail about our platform, down to every single line of code. We will show you how we are different from other platforms and how we are changing the dating world. We will show you how we are making the dating world more realistic and transparent.

# Decentralization

We are a decentralized platform. This means that everyone will have a say in the platform. We will have a voting system where everyone can vote on the changes that they want to see. We will also have a system where everyone can see the changes that are being made to the platform. We believe that this is the best way to make a platform that is truly transparent and realistic.

# Transparency with Privacy

Your data will be kept anonymous unless you play the game which you will need to share your profile to other people. If you leave the game forever, you can also have the option to delete your data. We believe that this is the best way to keep your data safe and secure. The only thing that is left will be the transaction data which will be kept on the blockchain. This is the best way to keep your data safe and secure.

# Realistic Dating

In reality, dating is not about swiping left or right. It is about meeting new people and getting to know them. Meeting people is all about the decisions you make and the conversations you have. We believe that this is the best way to make a dating platform that is truly realistic, fully based on decision making with a little bit of luck. We believe that this is the best way to make a dating platform that is truly realistic and transparent. Hence, we implement a game where you have fixed amount of resources and you make decisions, and you meet people based on them. All of this will be kept on the blockchain so that everyone can see what is happening. This is the best way to make a dating platform that is truly realistic and transparent.

# Affordability

We want to make sure tat all this is affordable. Every week, there will be am amount of tokens set aside for new users. This tokens will be leased to new users that bought $10 worth of tokens to make up 100 tokens to start the game. They can use these tokens until their original sum runs out. Until the user is ready to leave the platform, the tokens will then go back to circulation. This is the best way to make sure that everyone can afford to use the platform with a low cost, as if you are unable to match, you can always leave the platform without losing any money.
