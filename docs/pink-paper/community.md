# Community

All of ByteLuv will be nothing without a community that supports it. 

## Community Governance

Everyone in the ByteLuv ecosystem will have a say in the platform. We will have a voting system where everyone can vote on the changes that they want to see. We will also have a system where everyone can see the changes that are being made to the platform. We believe that this is the best way to make a platform that is truly transparent and realistic.

## Community Incentives

We want to make sure that all this is affordable. Every week, there will be an amount of tokens set aside for new users. These tokens will be leased to new users that bought $10 worth of tokens to make up 100 tokens to start the game. They can use these tokens until their original sum runs out. Until the user is ready to leave the platform, the tokens will then go back to circulation. This is the best way to make sure that everyone can afford to use the platform with a low cost, as if you are unable to match, you can always leave the platform without losing any money.

## Community Engagement

Before releasing new features, we will engage with the community to get feedback on the features that they want to see. We believe that this is the best way to make a platform that is truly transparent and realistic. We will also have a system where everyone can see the changes that are being made to the platform. We believe that this is the best way to make a platform that is truly transparent and realistic.

## Community Waitlist

Anyone with a 100 tokens will be able to start the game. If the user is in the waitlist in the community, they will be able to start the game with $10 worth of tokens. This is the best way to make sure that everyone can afford to use the platform with a low cost, as if you are unable to match, you can always leave the platform without losing any money.


## Community Support

We will have a support system where everyone can ask questions and get help about the game.
