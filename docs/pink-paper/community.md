# Community & KOLs

ByteLuv community will be an event driven one with KOLs. KOLs can set up events using \$BLUV, and interact with the community using the [The ByteLuv Game](../byteLuv-tutorial/byteluv-game.md#the-byteluv-game). The community will be able to participate in these events and earn rewards in the form of \$BLUV tokens.

## KOLs

KOLs are the key opinion leaders in the web 3.0 space. KOLs are able to leverage the ByteLuv platform to interact with users, e.g. by playing the game and choosing a user to bring for a date, or a lucky draw of locations where a pool of \$BLUV tokens can be claimed by users who happened to play the game at that location.

:::note
\$BLUV that are minted are specially allocated for KOLs to organize events. The \$BLUV will minted will be split based on the number of participants in the event, but the KOLs will have a fixed cut of the minted \$BLUV.

## Community

Any player will be able to participate in these events and earn rewards in the form of \$BLUV. Being in the community will allows players to get notified about the events that are happening in the platform. 

Decentrilized verification will also kick in, the community will have a dedicated channel to flag out users they think are not genuine or have proof that they are not genuine. When flagged with more than 50 flags, the user's token account will be frozen and it will take 200 more flags for the user to be banned from the platform.

:::note
The community will be able to earn \$BLUV by participating in events and flagging out users that are not genuine. Promoting an engaging and safe environment.

## Events

KOLs that initiate an event will have the ability to set the rules of the event. Each KOL will split the **[total minted \$BLUV allocation for community](./tokenomics.md#token-distribution)** based on the number of KOLs that intent to organize events. For example: If 10 KOLs are initiating event and the total minted \$BLUV allocation for community is 100,000 \$BLUV for that day, each KOL will get 10,000 \$BLUV to organize the event.

### Event Types

1. **Date Night**: KOLs can play the game and meet people which they can stake on. The user that first match with the KOL will be able to go on a date with the KOL. The event can then be recorded and uploaded to social media platforms. Of course, there is an incentive for the user to go on a date with the KOL, which is an amount of \$BLUV tokens that is set by the KOL.

2. **Lucky Draw**: KOLs can set up a lucky draw event where users can participate by playing the game. The lucky draw will be based on the locations that the users are playing the game at. The lucky draw will be done at the end of the event and the users that are at the location that is drawn will be able to claim the pool of \$BLUV tokens that is set by the KOL.

3. **Meet & Greet**: KOLs can set up a party event where users can participate by playing the game. Users that chosen the location that the KOL is at will be able to meet the KOL in person at the party venue. The KOL will be able to interact with the users and take photos with them. The users that are at the party will be able to claim the pool of \$BLUV tokens that is set by the KOL.

:::note
All events that are funded by \$BLUV will need to be recorded and uploaded to social media platforms. So that the community can see what is happening in the event.
